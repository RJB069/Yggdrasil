			<p>Helheim or Hel is the underworld of in Norse mythology, it is ruled by Hel a goddess or giantess who the daughter of Loki and Angrboda. 
			Angrbooa "The on who brings grief" or "She who offers sorrow" is the wife of Loke and has two siblings the Fennrir wolf, and the Midgard serpent.  
			Angrbooa lives in Jotunheim land of the giants with her daughter Hel, rules in Helheim or Hel. Hel is considered to be greedy, harsh and cruel at 
			best she is indifferent to the concerns of the both the living and the dead. The Soles that don't make it to Valhalla go to Hel. Unlike today's 
			picture of hell, it is not a fiery place where soles burn, it is an icy cold place. The entrance to which is a cave.</p>

				
			
			<p>Hel, the Fennrir wolf and the Midgard serpent were considered monsters and a source of fear. There are stories told about each of them 
				and the reasons that you should fear them. In Norse mythology the entrance to Helheim is guarded by Garm a "Hell Hound" who is bound to 
				the cave Gnipahulen. Whenever new people arrive that the Garm, howls letting <span title="A serpent that chews on one of Yggdrasil's roots.(See Yddgrasil for more detail.)"><u>Nidhogg</u></span> know that new blood is on its way, the serpent drinks the blood of the dead that is 
				why they are pale. Hel herself is surrounded by Nagrindr "Corpse-Fence". Hel lives in a large hall called "Icy cold and sleet", her bed 
				called "sick-bed" the curtains around it are misfortune, her table is named Hunger, and the knife starvation. Hel has an army of the dead 
				that will sail to Asgard when <span title="Doomsday"><u>Ragnarok</u></span> comes, in her ship Naglfar, built with the nails form the dead.  
				 come.<!--<abbr title="Doomsday">Ragnarok</abbr>
