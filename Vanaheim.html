			<p>Vanaheim is the home of the old gods, or the Vanir. The Vanir are associated fertility and nature, then the other Norse gods, known as the Aesir, who live 
			in Asgard. Little is know about Vannaheim other than it lies somewhere west of Asgard. Another clue to the state of Vanaheim is in the name. Asgard and Midgard 
			both have the suffix -gard, indicating, in pre-christian Norse the concept of innangard and utangard, meaning "inside the fence" and "outside the fence". 
			"Inside the fence" indicates a law-abiding, and civilized sense of order. While "outside the fence" is thought of as chaotic, and anarchic, or wild. Instead 
			of Vanagard, we have Vanaheim signifying a chaotic or wild realm. <span title="Is a wing female warrior that is tasked with bringing the honored home to the the halls of Valhalla.">
			 <u>Valkyre</u></span> bring the honored dead, those how have fallen in combat. The only way to enter these hollowed halls was to die in battle, those that died of
			old age or disease were not permitted into Valhalla, but were sent to Helheim Realm of the Dishonored Dead.<br /></p>
			
			<div><p>Little is known about the Vanir god and goddess, other than 
			<span title="Freyja or Freya is Odin's wife, and a powerful magic user, she is not known for her fidelity to Odin. Freya has a fondness for love, fertility, beauty and fine material possessions earning her a reputation of a 'party girl'. She is an honorarymemeber of the Aesir gods, as Odin's wife."
			><u>Freyja</u></span> , <span title="Freyr was Freyja bother and known as 'The foremost of the gods and hated by none' his symbol was a golden boar, he is also closely related to chariots and ships. Freyr's blessings would manifest in the from of sexual and ecological fertility, wealth and peace. People would often sacrifice his favourite animal to him, a boar, during weddings.  "><u>Freyr</u>,</span>
			 and <span title="Njord is the father of Freyja, and Freyr, their mother is unknown. He was married to a giantess for a short time, her name was Skadi. It was a short and unhappy marriage."
			><u>Njord</u></span> belong the Vanir tribe of gods other than their association with fertility and nature.</p></div>
